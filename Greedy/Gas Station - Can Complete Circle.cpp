// There are N gas stations along a circular route, where the amount of gas at station i is gas[i].
// You have a car with an unlimited gas tank and it costs cost[i] of gas to travel from station i to its next station
// (i+1). You begin the journey with an empty tank at one of the gas stations. Return the minimum starting gas stationâ€™s
// index if you can travel around the circuit once, otherwise return -1. You can only travel in one direction. i to i+1,
// i+2, ... n-1, 0, 1, 2.. Completing the circuit means starting at i and ending up at i again.

//  Greedily, if your tank becomes empty, start from the next station
